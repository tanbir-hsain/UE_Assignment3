Genomic Assignment 3
====================

This project analyzes genomic FASTA files and demonstrates:
- FASTA parsing and validation
- Sequence search and analysis
- Parallel and memory-efficient processing
- Performance measurement and logging
- Integration via command-line interface

Instructions:
1. Place all files in one folder:
   ├── fasta_handler.py
   ├── performance_tools.py
   ├── main.py
   ├── sample.fasta
   └── README.txt

2. Open the folder in VS Code.

3. Run the main program:
   python main.py

4. Choose an option from the menu to explore the tools.
